## Encryption

Vock is using RSA private key for initial handshake to encrypt
[Diffie-Hellman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)
public keys. All further communication is performed under AES-256 encryption.

By default, Vock is using RSA private key located at ~/.ssh/id_rsa. If you get
`Private key should be loaded first` error, please ensure that you have key at
this place and, if your key has secured with password, that `VOCK_KEY_PASSWORD`
environment variable is set. If you want to use other key, specify it's location
in `VOCK_KEY_FILE` variable.
